description: "Clay is a joining the lab as a Postdoctoral Scholar. He received his bachelor’s degree in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering from The University of Tennessee where he worked with Dr. Steven Abel to understand the cytoskeletal assembly using mesoscale simulations. During his time at UT, he worked as an ORISE research assistant at Oak Ridge National Lab developing biopolymers for sustainable additive manufacturing applications under the supervision of Dr. Xianhui Zhao.
Clay recently received his Ph.D. from Auburn University, working in the lab of Dr. Robert Pantazes. Here he developed engineering principles for computational protein design, integrating techniques such as Molecular Dynamics, MM/GB(PB)SA, Docking, Structure Prediction and Inverse Folding to analyze Protein—Protein Interfaces and create a novel feature space applied to ∆∆G prediction and computational affinity maturation. He is interested in understanding the latent representations and biophysical interactions that encode and are employed in protein dynamics.




Away from his computer, he enjoys reading, creative writing, running, and golfing."
