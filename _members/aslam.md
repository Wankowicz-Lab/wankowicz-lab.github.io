description: "Ahmed is an undergraduate pre-medical student at Vanderbilt University double majoring in Biochemistry and Computer Science. He is determined to integrate his passion for medicine and computer science to uncover the underlying mechanisms driving health from a biophysical perspective. He is particularly interested in how microscopic variations in molecular structures can have major effects on cellular and viral processes. Using advanced computational approaches, Ahmed aims to understand more about the processes that sustain life and apply his research toward transformative solutions in healthcare.


When he's not in the lab, you can find him enjoying good weather, playing Spikeball, or playing video games. "
