We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an advertised open position. We are interested in conversing with you about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across various computational and experimental techniques. If interested, please send your CV/Resume to <a href="mailto:stephanie@wankowiczlab.com">Dr. Stephanie Wankowicz</a>.


## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to <a href="mailto:stephanie@wankowiczlab.com">Dr. Stephanie Wankowicz</a>. We encourage candidates to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.


## Graduate Students

At Vanderbilt, students can apply to multiple [graduate programs](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/bret/prospective-students/) and do not apply directly to labs. 

Once students are admitted to Vanderbilt, during the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~4 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is open for rotation students wanting to work on experimental or computational approaches and will generally have room for 1-2 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year. We encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, scientific chemistry, and alignment with lab values. 


## Undergraduate Students

We are currently not accepting any undergraduate students. Students are expected to commit to working at least 10 hours a week. We have projects ranging from new machine learning algorithms and bioinformatic analysis to protein expression and characterization. If interested, please send your CV/Resume to <a href="mailto:stephanie@wankowiczlab.com">Dr. Stephanie Wankowicz</a>.
