## Our Mission

<ol style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.3em;">
Our goal is to become the best scientists that we can be, believing that excellence in science will naturally follow. To achieve this, we dedicate ourselves to the following guiding principles.
</ol>

</div>

<ol style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.1em;">
    <li>Be kind, welcoming, and collaborative – support people personally and professionally. We aim for the lab to be a welcoming environment where everyone can be their best selves.</li>

    <br>
    <li>Be curious – ask questions, talk to other scientists about their work, and read literature outside of your field (and in your field!).</li>
    <br>
    
    <li>Be creative — envision what comes next. Crazy ideas are great and welcome!</li>
    <br>
    
    <li>Be rigorous – check your work, have your neighbor check your work, and always consider the appropriate controls, even if it is not the most exciting part of science.</li>
    <br>
    
    <li>Be open – the best science is open science. We are building on centuries of science, and we want others to build on our science for centuries. To achieve this, we must openly share our scientific discoveries, code, and data.</li>
</ol>
