description: "Mingbin obtained a doctoral degree in chemistry from University of Maryland, College Park in 2022. Under the supervision of Prof. Osvaldo Gutierrez in the graduate school, he used density functional theory (DFT) to unravel the mechanism of organic radical transformations and homogeneous organometallic catalysis (e.g., photoredox/nickel dual catalysis and Fe-catalyzed multicomponent cross-coupling reactions). Theory-guided design was performed with the computed results and collaboration with the experimental team. From 2022 to 2025, Mingbin joined the Theoretical Division of Los Alamos National Laboratory as a postdoctoral research associate. Working with Dr. Ping Yang and Dr. Enrique Batista, he used DFT to study the structural, electronic and spectroscopic properties of f-element systems (e.g., lutetium photoswitch and actinide dioxide clusters). He was also involved in the development of semi-empirical method (i.e., density functional tight binding, DFTB) for f-element systems, with the goal of simulating systems with larger size and longer timescale. High-throughput computation workflow was built, allowing for efficient data management, analysis, and visualization. Machine learning methods (e.g., delta learning) was used to promote the accuracy of the trained parameters. With the expertise of physics-based simulations and data-driven methods, he is dedicated to the application of both approaches to solving challenges in computational biology and biophysics.

Outside the lab, you could find him chilling with his cats."
