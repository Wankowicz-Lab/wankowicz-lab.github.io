  <br>
  <br>
We seek to define how entropy governs binding and catalysis, combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and targeted experiments to expose the underlying structural and thermodynamic mechanisms.

We are part of the [Molecular Physiology & Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), the [Biochemistry Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/biochemistry/), the [Computer Science Department](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/departments/computer-science/), the [Center for Applied AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ai-proteindynamics/), and the [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/) at Vanderbilt University.
  <br>
  <br>
 The lab is located in 741 Light Hall.
