description: "Muriel holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, where she specialized in probabilistic modeling, Gaussian processes, and the dynamics of complex biological and human–machine systems. Her research spans structural modeling, statistical mechanics–inspired methods, and large-scale machine learning, with applications ranging from human motor prediction to biomedical data analysis.


She has worked across academia and industry, including roles at the Wharton School and BMW Group, designing reproducible data pipelines, predictive models, and computational frameworks used for decision-making, behavioral analysis, and human–machine interaction. Her interdisciplinary background integrates data science, statistical modeling, and collaborative research cycles with experimental and clinical partners.


Outside of research, Muriel enjoys spending time outdoors with her family, traveling, and exploring Nashville’s vibrant community.
