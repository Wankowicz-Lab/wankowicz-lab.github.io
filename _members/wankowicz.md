description: "Stephanie earned her bachelor’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where she researched the economics of the Clean Water Act under Dr. Paul Kolkoswki. After graduating, she worked as a Data Specialist at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) in the [Lank Center for Genitourinary Oncology](https://www.dana-farber.org/cancer-care/treatment/genitourinary-cancer), managing the Bladder Cancer Translational Research Center under [Joaquim Bellmunt](http://bellmuntoncologia.com). During this time, she performed clinical and translational research, helping to identify the relationship between the expression of PD-L1, an immune checkpoint marker, and overall survival in metastatic bladder cancer.


Subsequently, Stephanie worked as a computational biologist at the [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/) and the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), working in [Eli Van Allen's lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/). There, she developed algorithms utilizing high-throughput genomics data to assess responses to oncology treatments. She led the largest study of prostate cancer exomes, identifying new genes and pathways commonly mutated in prostate cancer. Additionally, she helped identify genetic biomarkers that predict patient responses to immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy.


In 2018, Stephanie began her graduate career in the [Biophysics program at UCSF](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/), working in [James Fraser’s lab](https://fraserlab.com/). She developed computational tools to automatically construct conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, extracting low-populated but biologically important states of macromolecules. Leveraging structural bioinformatics, she uncovered the spatial redistribution of entropy in ligand binding. Her graduate studies were supported by fellowships from [NSF](http://www.nsfgrfp.org/),  [UCSF Discovery Fellows Program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/discovery-fellows-program), and the [UCSF Antiviral Drug Discovery Program](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/qcrgAViDD). Her work has been recognized through many awards, including D.E. Shaw Computational Chemistry Fellowship, Intersections Science Fellowship, UCSF Mentorship Award, and Penn Rising Stars in Biophysics and Biochemistry.


In 2024, Stephanie opened her lab at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) in the [Molecular Physiology and Biophysics Department](https://medschool.vanderbilt.edu/mpb/), [Center for AI in Protein Dynamics](https://www.ai-proteindynamics.org/), and [Center for Structural Biology](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csb/). The lab has two main areas of research: (1) improving the modeling of structural conformational ensembles from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM data, (2) elucidating the structural mechanisms by which conformational entropy influences binding specificity and catalysis. Find out more about our current research [here](/research).


Stephanie is deeply committed to making science a welcoming place. At UCSF, she initiated a mentorship program for the [Biophysics program at UCSF](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/) and founded a DEIJ Journal Club in the [Fraser lab](https://fraserlab.com/tags/deij_jc/). 

Outside of the lab, you are most likely to find Stephanie running on the road or trail!"
